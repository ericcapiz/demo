## Description

This is the repo for the Listrak front-end assessment popup. The main page is the initial sign-up card. The user would need to enter an email address before clicking on the sign up page. Once the user enters the email and clicks "Sign Up" a popup confirmation would apper. User then can click the 'X' on top to close out of the pop to close and be returned to the main page. As requested per assessment guidelines, the application is mobile responsive. it works with a larger screen (1366 X 768) as well as the smaller screen (375 X 667). To confirm this right click anywhere on the browser and click 'inspect element' and near the top right part of the screen next to'Elements' there should be a tablet/phone icon to bring up page responsiveness. You can enter the 2 screen dimensions to see that the application is responsive to those specific screen sizes as requested.  View the page at https://eric-capiz-assessment.netlify.app/
